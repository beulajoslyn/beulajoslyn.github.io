                                    <p><center>An ongoing project, using a wireless radio called USRP and an open source Python embedded blocks. This project mainly deals with Destructive Interference, that is to achieve signal cancellation at the receiver’s end. It is a tedious task to achieve this objective because the attacker has to be in sync with the targeted signal, taking in consideration the frequency, amplitude and timing of the signal.</center></p>

                                        An independent study on Cloud Computing, deployed a private cloud using an open source tool OpenNebula.
                                        Used Ubuntu 16.04 as the master node and Ubuntu 14.04 as the slave. Transferred the SSH keys, ran the virtual machine and downloaded an image on the dashboard and used the image as well. 
                                        And deployed another private cloud to know the working of VMWare a virtual toolbox to host a virtual machine. Launched a DDoS attack on the cloud to know the insecurities of the cloud platform.

                                            Describes a way to recieve money more securely. Since, Triple DES uses keys thrice, it
                                            is considered to be more secure and is sometimes preferred over the normal DES. The system combines the required
                                            input and encrypts with Triple-DES. OTP is a randomly generated number encrypted likewise.
                                            Hence Triple-DES was used to secure sender's information and DES was used to secure the
                                            OTP. Once the OTP is generated, it is valid only till a specific transaction is completed and later behaves as nonce.

                                        This particular internship mainly aims at communication through serial interface. It shows communication between two wireless devices without another device eavesdropping the message.
                                        Serial communication is the process of sending data one bit at a time sequentially, over a communication bus or ocmputer bus. We implemeted this using RS-232, PIC-18F25K22 and MAX4800. The information
                                        at the PIC is in the form of UART and the output from the PIC is sent to a switch (MAX 4800). The PIC was programmed in Embedded C to decicde what information to pass and to prioritize the proper tranmitter aptly.
                                        The output would be shown on the LED display.
